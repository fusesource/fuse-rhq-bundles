## Fuse RHQ Bundles

The Fuse RHQ Bundles create [RHQ Ant Recipes](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/Ant+Bundles#AntBundles-AntRecipes) for provisioning JBoss Fuse via RHQ/JON.

To be able to use them you need to install the **rhq-ant** binary first if you are using these from outside of the RHQ/JON application.

To install these bundles, cd into the correct directory and then run

    rhq-ant -Drhq.deploy.dir=/tmp/mydirectory
